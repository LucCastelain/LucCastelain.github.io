Il est développé avec un ami à l'aide du moteur Godot.\nChaque monde est généré de manière procédurale grâce à des textures de bruit et un système de threads. Il crée un monde infini avec différents biomes en fonction de la profondeur (profondeur verticale dans le monde) et de la température (déterminée par les textures de bruit).\nDes gemmes apparaissent également en fonction des biomes et de la profondeur.\n\nLe joueur peut échanger et fabriquer des objets, ainsi qu'améliorer son personnage. Il peut combattre des monstres et accomplir des quêtes.\nLe jeu est jouable jusqu'à 4 joueurs en local et est entièrement compatible avec une manette.\n\nCe jeu est encore en développement et possède une page Steam.",

The game is about competing with your friends to be the one to get the more treasures in a dungeon while escaping the attacks of a dragon. You can choose between staying longer in the dungeon and try to get richer or go back to the surface faster, with less treasures but hoping the other contestants will die by the dragon.\nWe wanted to have fun recreating the game as much as we could. To evolve in the dungeon, you play cards that you can buy while playing. We had to make the moving of the player on the board, the shop system as well as the deck building mechanic in only two days.\n\nIt was difficult but a lot of fun. We were two programmers on Unity3D and 3 for the graphics (cards and cinematic). At the end of the jam we were exhausted but happy that we could play our board game on a computer!",
